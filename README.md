# DenseNet-Cifar

### DenseNet-CIFAR10

A DenseNet is a CNN based acrhitecture that utilizes dense connection between layers to deal with the vanishing gradient problem. In this notebook, we will implement the DenseNet architecture as presented in the research paper to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Objective
Classify CIFAR-10 images using a DenseNet CNN implementation.
